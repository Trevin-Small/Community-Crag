# [Community-Crag](https://communitycrag.com)
**A collaborative website that allows climbers to share add on problems and suggest grades on climbs.  
Basically, a form of social media for climbing gyms.**

![Community Crag Home](https://github.com/Trevin-Small/Community-Crag/blob/main/dist/assets/ccrag.png)

All posts are public, and can be viewed by any visitor. However, creating posts and suggesting grades requires users to sign in. (With a Purdue email). 

### Note: 
This website is mobile-first. While computer navigation is still supported, the website is best viewed on a mobile device.

## About the website:
#### Open source forever! Fork it, use it at your gym, or modify it and use it for something besides climbing!
- Built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla javascript, Firebase/Firestore, Google cloud storage API. Bundled with webpack.

Targeted at the Purdue University Climbing wall to improve the climbing experience for all students.
